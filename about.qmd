I am an undergraduate student at Colorado State University studying ecosystem science and sustainability. I grew up in the beautiful state of Arkansas exploring nature, which helped to nurture my love and appreciation for the outdoors.

My technical skills may be green, but my desire for helping nature thrive is strong.
